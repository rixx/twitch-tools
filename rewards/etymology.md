- Kitchen, OEng cycene, proto germanic kokina, from Latin coquina (kitchen), which also survives as cuisine, from Latin
  coquere, to cook, (yes, same word). Also in Italian as *cotta: ricotta, terra cotta. Comes from PIE *pekw "cook, ripen"
  also leading to kiln, precocious (early ripening), apricot (early ripening fruit), of course biscuit (twice-baked)
- Poll used to mean "head", hence the poll tax 1690. Therefore also tadpole: toad head, and poleaxe: axe head. Then the
  counting of heads around 1620, then the poll as modern election as 1832.
- 'Hollow': germanic, holh/*hul. Related the same word in German, 'hohl', and also 'Höhle' (cave).
  The very ancient root is *kel-, PIE for "to cover, to conceal, to save", probably, which leads to the Sanskrit 'cala' (cave),
  Latin 'cella' (store room), 'clam' (secret)
- 'Chest' likely comes from an early borrowing of a Latin word into the Germanic languages,
  with the usual change of a Latin /k/ sound to English /t͡ʃ/.
  That Latin ancestor is cista, itself borrowed from Ancient Greek kístē 'box',
  and also the origin of the word 'cistern'.
  English consistently shows this change of /k/ to /t͡ʃ/ in these early borrowings,
  while other Germanic languages have maintained the original /k/ sound. (cf cheese!)
- 'Wall' comes from the Latin word vallum, a kind of defensive mound or rampart.
  A space between two valla, and consequently any gap between two things, is an intervallum - hence English 'interval'.
  'Vallum' exists in English too, as a technical term for a rampart.
  Both 'wall' and 'vallum' exist side by side in the parts of Hadrian's Wall, referring to different parts
  - confusingly, the 'Vallum' is used for the country-long ditch to the south of the wall.
  English isn't the only language to get a word for 'wall' from Latin - German and Dutch have the words Mauer and muur, from Latin mūrus.
  (which, in English, arrived as mural)
  Also German as "Wall" (though there's a version than means '80 pieces' in relation to fish)
- "outrage" has nothing to do with out or rage
  It's from Old French outre 'beyond' (itself from Latin ultra) plus the suffix -age
  (itself from Latin -āticum, cf. Latin villāticum > French/English village)!
  Both its sounds and senses have since been influenced by 'out' and 'rage' though.
- September/seven: Septem is a member of the big Indo-European family of 'seven' words that also includes
  Welsh saith, Czech sedm, Sanskrit sapta and Greek heptá.
- wade: PIE word that appears only in Germanic languages + Latin.
  Obviously German waten (same meaning), but also ford/Furt, latin vadere (to go) and vadare (to wade)
  used to be a strong verb until the 16th cent!
  NOT related to "water", but via latin to invasion, and via spanish to vamoose (actual spanish vamos)
- but King: from cyning, which, from *kuningaz, wherefrom König.
  unsure origin: could be from cynn (-> kin), and therefore leader of people
  or from old germanic word for noble birth. much debate among sociology based historian speculations
  BUT but the originally used word: þeoden (king, chief of tribe)
- ridge: hrycg (back of man or animal), proto-germanic hruggin, German "Rücken". Also used to be the highest part of a
  building. Lost these meanings by the 17th century. -dg- spelling is from the 15th century. the reconstructed PIE root
  is related to a TON of words, like ring, range, crown and so on, but a bit more tentative than most
- bridge: brycge, also in Dutch, Frisian, German, etc. PIE is *bhru, "log, beam". Serbian brv for "footbridge". the game
  bridge is completely unrelated, possibly from Turkish *bir-üç "one-three," because one hand is exposed and three are concealed


# Done

- world: composite, wer-ald/wor-old. "wer" as in "werwolf" (vir): man/human, and "old" as in age, age-of-man.
  basically contrasts with afterlife, this is OUR realm, while the word for world in middle english was Middangeard
  (germanic cosmology yay)
- 'Knight': germanic, same word as the German 'Knecht' (farm hand, servant). Plural used to be 'knighten'. Rose in
  meaning from 'servant' to 'military follower' in the hundred years war, and by the 16th cent had finally reached
  nobility. In German, literally being unfree. We don't have any other root words!
- midwife: mid (as german mit, with) and wif (woman)
- desk and disc both derive from the greek diskos, which in turn started as the verb diskein, to throw. disc was then
  the thing you threw, while discus in latin meant "platter", and in medieval latin turned into "writing table" (desca)
- fee, from PIE for "cattle". Merged from OEng "feoh" (livestock, still alive in German Vieh), from PIE peku* (pecu,
  cattle and pecunia, Money). ALSO from OFrench fieu, meaning and evolving into fief.
  meaning evolved from cattle, to land  holdings, to heritable services to be paid to a feudal lord, and then just money
  paid for a privilege
  feudal
- book! -> german buch, buche (beech), probably from writing on beechwood tablets. tree-based writing words common,
  latin from birch, sanskrit is from ash, librum/livre/library/libretto from "inner bark of trees" (russian lub means
  bark!). fun fact, library used to be bochord, literally book hoard (cf thesaurus)
  BUT to book sth is a completely different work, OEng bocian, to grant/assign by charter
- *reg, PIE: move in a straight line -> rule. in direct and erect, blush. but the other meaning in reign, reich, bishopric
  friedrich/frederick, reckless, regal, sanskrit raj (king), and, of course: gaulish RIX (vercingetorix): king, and all
  forms of right/recht/recte/straight
- road: used to be riding expedition, literally from ride(rode), also raid (mounted expedition). From here obviously
  also reiten.
  BUT riding as in district: different word entirely, like *þriðing, third-part/thing (via old norse) when counties were split
  in parts of three, which goes directly to three/drei/tri/triss (irish)/tertius
- Threat: originally meant "crowd, troop" (and related to a germanic word, threotan, weary: in the German 'verdrossen',
  vexed, grumpy). PIE *treud: to push. Found in latin treudere (to press), into extrude, intrude etc. (threat of
  intrusion hehe)
  Also related to "thrust" (probably), but **not** to tryst.
- chernobyl: name of wormwood and similar plants, literally "black grass". cherno/chorno is proto-slavic čьrnъ black,
  PIE root is *kers-no: black, dark, and in Sanskrit: krshnah, Krishna: the Black One (avatar of vishnu)
- wax as in waxing moon: still alive in german, wachsen. from PIE *weg/*aug, leading to very recognisable greek auxein
  (increase), which in turn is related to augmentare, augment, August, author(ity), and even,lmao, waist (via waest,
  where the body grows)
- "ear" has strong PIE roots as many fundamental words do. Ohr, øre, aus (greek), auris, ausis (lithuanian)
  unrelated: an ear of corn, west saxon æher, related to ähre, Latin acus (chaff), greek akoste (barley) – all generally
  from *ak, pointy thing (-> acid, acute, exACerbated) etc
- 'Persuade' comes from Latin suādēre 'to advise'.
  Suādēre likely once meant 'to make sweet/agreeable',
  as it shares a root with suāvis 'sweet' - from which English gets 'suave'.
  Both words are related to 'sweet' itself, as well as to Greek hēdonḗ 'pleasure' - hence 'hedonism'.
- Migraine directly from Greek hemi krania: half the head (migraines affect usually one side of the head). This in turn
  was possibly a calque of an egypt word. krania = cranium, via Latin. Always means head, PIE *ker means "horn, head".
  Also in "carrot" (anything pointy growing out of stuff), horn(et), etc.
