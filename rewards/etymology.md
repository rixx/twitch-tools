- 'Knight': germanic, same word as the German 'Knecht' (farm hand, servant). Plural used to be 'knighten'. Rose in
  meaning from 'servant' to 'military follower' in the hundred years war, and by the 16th cent had finally reached
  nobility. In German, literally being unfree. We don't have any other root words!
- 'Hollow': germanic, holh/*hul. Related the same word in German, 'hohl', and also 'Höhle' (cave). But NOT 'hull',
  unless you go back way further.
  The very ancient root is *kel-, PIE for "to cover, to conceal, to save", probably, which leads to the Sanskrit 'cala' (cave),
  Latin 'cella' (store room), 'clam' (secret)
- 'Hull': from 'hulu', to cover: first a word for seed coverings, still in German/Dutch as Hülle/Hülse (shell, husk).
  From there to the ship hull, because it functions like a seed/nut shell
  OR!! might instead come from 'hold'
- 'Persuade' comes from Latin suādēre 'to advise'.
  Suādēre likely once meant 'to make sweet/agreeable',
  as it shares a root with suāvis 'sweet' - from which English gets 'suave'.
  Both words are related to 'sweet' itself, as well as to Greek hēdonḗ 'pleasure' - hence 'hedonism'.
- 'Chest' likely comes from an early borrowing of a Latin word into the Germanic languages,
  with the usual change of a Latin /k/ sound to English /t͡ʃ/.
  That Latin ancestor is cista, itself borrowed from Ancient Greek kístē 'box',
  and also the origin of the word 'cistern'.
  English consistently shows this change of /k/ to /t͡ʃ/ in these early borrowings,
  while other Germanic languages have maintained the original /k/ sound. (cf cheese!)
- 'Wall' comes from the Latin word vallum, a kind of defensive mound or rampart.
  A space between two valla, and consequently any gap between two things, is an intervallum - hence English 'interval'.
  'Vallum' exists in English too, as a technical term for a rampart.
  Both 'wall' and 'vallum' exist side by side in the parts of Hadrian's Wall, referring to different parts
  - confusingly, the 'Vallum' is used for the country-long ditch to the south of the wall.
  English isn't the only language to get a word for 'wall' from Latin - German and Dutch have the words Mauer and muur, from Latin mūrus.
  (which, in English, arrived as mural)
  Also German as "Wall" (though there's a version than means '80 pieces' in relation to fish)
- "outrage" has nothing to do with out or rage
  It's from Old French outre 'beyond' (itself from Latin ultra) plus the suffix -age
  (itself from Latin -āticum, cf. Latin villāticum > French/English village)!
  Both its sounds and senses have since been influenced by 'out' and 'rage' though.
- September/seven: Septem is a member of the big Indo-European family of 'seven' words that also includes
  Welsh saith, Czech sedm, Sanskrit sapta and Greek heptá.
- midwife: mid (as german mit, with) and wif (woman)
- desk and disc both derive from the greek diskos, which in turn started as the verb diskein, to throw. disc was then
  the thing you threw, while discus in latin meant "platter", and in medieval latin turned into "writing table" (desca)
- wade: PIE word that appears only in Germanic languages + Latin.
  Obviously German waten (same meaning), but also ford/Furt, latin vadere (to go) and vadare (to wade)
  used to be a strong verb until the 16th cent!
  NOT related to "water", but via latin to invasion, and via spanish to vamoose (actual spanish vamos)
- naprawo geradeaus auf serbisch und rechts auf russisch
- -win or win- (edwin, winfried): from wi·ne, friend. Very distantly related to Venus!
- *reg, PIE: move in a straight line -> rule. in direct and erect, blush. but the other meaning in reign, reich, bishopric
  friedrich/frederick, reckless, regal, sanskrit raj (king), and, of course: gaulish RIX (vercingetorix): king, and all
  forms of right/recht/recte/straight
- but King: from cyning, which, from *kuningaz, wherefrom König.
  unsure origin: could be from cynn (-> kin), and therefore leader of people
  or from old germanic word for noble birth. much debate among sociology based historian speculations
  BUT but the originally used word: þeoden (king, chief of tribe)
- fee, from PIE for "cattle". Merged from OEng "feoh" (livestock, still alive in German Vieh), from PIE peku* (pecu,
  cattle and pecunia, Money). ALSO from OFrench fieu, meaning and evolving into fief.
  meaning evolved from cattle, to land  holdings, to heritable services to be paid to a feudal lord, and then just money
  paid for a privilege
  feudal
- treasure, treasury: related to german "tresor" (safe), both from greek/latin thesaurus
- book! -> german buch, buche (beech), probably from writing on beechwood tablets. tree-based writing words common,
  latin from birch, sanskrit is from ash, librum/livre/library/libretto from "inner bark of trees" (russian lub means
  bark!). fun fact, library used to be bochord, literally book hoard (cf thesaurus)
  BUT to book sth is a completely different work, OEng bocian, to grant/assign by charter
- "ear" has strong PIE roots as many fundamental words do. Ohr, øre, aus (greek), auris, ausis (lithuanian)
  unrelated: an ear of corn, west saxon æher, related to ähre, Latin acus (chaff), greek akoste (barley) – all generally
  from *ak, pointy thing (-> acid, acute, exACerbated) etc
- atone: literally just at-one, originally "reconcile" (reparations/making up for only starting 1600s)
  modelled explicitly after adunare/adunamentum for atonement! theology blah
- wax as in waxing moon: still alive in german, wachsen. from PIE *weg/*aug, leading to very recognisable greek auxein
  (increase), which in turn is related to augmentare, augment, August, author(ity), and even,lmao, waist (via waest,
  where the body grows)
- road: used to be riding expedition, literally from ride(rode), also raid (mounted expedition). From here obviously
  also reiten.
  BUT riding as in district: different word entirely, like *þriðing, third-part/thing (via old norse) when counties were split
  in parts of three, which goes directly to three/drei/tri/triss (irish)/tertius


# Done

- world: composite, wer-ald/wor-old. "wer" as in "werwolf" (vir): man/human, and "old" as in age, age-of-man.
  basically contrasts with afterlife, this is OUR realm, while the word for world in middle english was Middangeard
  (germanic cosmology yay)
